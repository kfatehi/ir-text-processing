Once you have implemented your palindrome counting algorithm, please perform a short analysis of its runtime complexity: Does it run in linear t.ime relative to the size of the input? polynomial time? exponential time? This analysis should go in the analysis.txt file in this package.


Graphing Procedure:

# run for as long as you want to collect data
make analyzer-collect

# open the graph
open test/support/analyzer/index.html
